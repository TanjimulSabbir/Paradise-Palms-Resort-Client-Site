## Paradise Palms Resort

Paradise Palms resort is a robust and feature-rich web application that enables users to book resort rooms seamlessly. The application is designed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to provide a seamless and responsive user experience across all devices.

The application has been designed using the Tailwind CSS framework to ensure that it is fully responsive and provides a great user experience on any device. User authentication and authorization have been integrated into the application using JWT Tokens, which means users can securely access their accounts.

The application provides users with the ability to search for rooms based on their preferences and book them using a user-friendly interface. The search functionality allows users to filter rooms by date and booking name, making it easy to find the right room for their needs.

The admin panel of the application is packed with features that enable the resort staff to manage rooms, bookings, and users with ease. The admin can view all the bookings made by users and manage them as needed. They can also manage rooms by changing their details, images, and other information.

The application integrates with Stripe for payment gateway services, enabling users to pay for their bookings securely. However, this feature is currently unavailable due to some reasons.

The admin panel provides the resort staff with full control over user management, allowing them to view all users' details, delete users, and grant admin or moderator privileges.Overall, this platform offers a convenient and secure booking experience for users.
